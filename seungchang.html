        Hello world! <br> <br>
        Daniel Chang <br> <br>
        I will give 9 out of 10 for the git assignment excitement it's fun but little bit confusing.
        For class I can give 9.5 out of 10 with the same reason but I am looking forward to built my own portfolio website :)
        From the Data Wrangling class to Digital Product Management class I am enjoying learning for Professor Colbert. I feel like he takes care of each students whenever they need help. <br> <br>
